                <h2>Welcome to Primary Health</h2>
                <p>We build software to help independent primary care providers run their practice. We can help independent primary care doctors practice value-based care for their Medicaid patients.</p>
                <p> Originally from the Bronx, we wanted to find a way to improve primary care for Medicaid populations in New York. By helping providers meet quality goals, generating reports, and automatically certifying them for government programs, we help practices earn more revenue per year while also reducing burnout.</p>
                <p> We saw first-hand how underserved and bogged down independent practices are as we spent months building software for our family's private practice in New York City.</p>

                    <li><strong>Why Switch?</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The government is cutting fee-for-service payments slowly to incentivize the shift to value-based care and so that they can save money.</li>
                            <li>Practices are missing out on a huge financial uplift by not taking advantage of these value-based care frameworks. Our first practice earned an additional $350k+.</li>
                            <li>Weâ€™ll identify these opportunities and automatically do the work to get your patients in the door.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Health Equity and Quality First:</strong> By ensuring your highest acuity patients (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) are coming in at the right time and proactively, we are helping the practice to drive towards better quality and patient outcomes.</li>
